# Join the community!
We always welcome new ideas and suggestions via [issues](https://github.com/TeleIO/Telemachus-1/issues), but sometimes live chat is better.  To support that, we have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/nkbauw7) server setup where most contributors hang out.  Feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, or just hang out with us.

# Current status of project
The project is actively being developed and we're looking for your input!  Also, work has started on a v2.0 to modernize the code base and update many of the systems.  If you have feature requests, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/TeleIO/Telemachus-1/issues) so we can prioritize the work.

# Building the plugin
There are a few steps to building the plugin.  Please refer to the [build guide](https://github.com/TeleIO/Telemachus-1/wiki/Building-Telemachus-Reborn) for instructions.
