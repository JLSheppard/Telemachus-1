If you're really interested in making an impact, feel free to grab a bug or feature off of the backlog and drop a pull request!  This is one of the best ways to have a lasting impact on Telemachus.  Take a look at our [contributing](https://github.com/TeleIO/Telemachus-1/wiki/Contributing) guidelines, then grab your copy and start coding - we truly appreciate the help!
